This guide walks you through the process of executing a Spring Batch
job and its partitioned steps on Hadoop YARN in a way of simulating an
error in a partitioned step and restart of a job.

== What you'll build

You'll build a simple Hadoop YARN application with Spring Hadoop and
Spring Boot. This application contains a job with two master steps
where actual execution is done on YARN as partitioned steps. We also
simulate an error of step execution order to demonstrate a job restart
so that step execution is continued from failed steps.

== What you'll need

include::https://raw.github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]
 - Local single-node instance based on Hadoop 2.2.0 or later

NOTE: Testing this sample application don't need existing or running Hadoop instance.

== Set up the project

First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with http://gradle.org[Gradle] is included here. If you're not familiar with it, refer to link:/guides/gs/gradle[Building Java Projects with Gradle].

include::https://raw.github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/create_directory_structure_yarn_test_hello.adoc[]

=== Create a Gradle build file
Below is the https://github.com/spring-guides/{project_id}/blob/master/initial/build.gradle[initial Gradle build file]. If you are using link:/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)], you can import the guide directly.

`build.gradle`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[]
----

In above gradle build file we simply create three different jars, each having classes for its specific role. These jars are then repackaged by Spring Boot's gradle plugin to create an executable jars.

== Create a Remote Batch Step

Here you create a `HdfsTasklet` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/HdfsTasklet.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/HdfsTasklet.java[]
----

- We `@AutoWired` Hadoop's `Configuration` to be able to use
  `FsShell`.
- We simply check if a file exists in HDFS and throw
  `RuntimeException` if file doesn't exist. This is done to simulate
  error in a `Tasklet`. If file does exist we simply return `FINISHED`
  from a `Tasklet`.
- To figure out which file name to use we access stepname which looks
  something like `remoteStep1:partition0` and remove illegal
  characters.

Here you create a `ContainerApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java[]
----

- We simply create two steps named `remoteStep1` and `remoteStep2` and
  attach `HdfsTasklet` to those steps.

== Create a Batch Job

Here you create a `AppmasterApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java[]
----

- We simply create two master steps named `master1` and `master2`.
  Instruct those steps to be partitioned on YARN and set grid size to
  two.

== Create a Yarn Client

Here you create a `ClientApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java[]
----

 - {EnableAutoConfiguration}[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath setting, other beans, and various property settings.
 - Specific auto-configuration for Spring YARN components takes place in a same way than from a core Spring Boot.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. From there we simply request a bean of type {YarnClient}[`YarnClient`] and execute its `submitApplication()` method. What happens next depends on application configuration, which we go through later in this guide. Did you notice that there wasn't a single line of XML?

include::https://raw.github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_yarn_application.adoc[]

== Run the Application

Now that you’ve successfully compiled and packaged your application,
it’s time to do the fun part and execute it on a Hadoop YARN.

Because we need to persist a Spring Batch job status a database is
needed. We've bundled an instance of `HSQL` which is easy to start
as a in-memory mode:
```
$ cd db/
$ unzip hsqldb-2.3.1.zip 
$ cd hsqldb-2.3.1/hsqldb/data/
$ java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0
mem:testdb --dbname.0 testdb --silent false --trace true
```

First create two empty files `/tmp/remoteStep1partition0` and `/tmp/remoteStep1partition1`
in HDFS:
```
$ hdfs dfs -touch /tmp/remoteStep1partition0
$ hdfs dfs -touch /tmp/remoteStep1partition1
```
Then run the application:
```
$ cd gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist
$ java -jar target/gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client-0.1.0.jar
```
If you for example check the application status from a YARN resource
manager, you'll see that application FAILED because partitioned steps
on a second phase failed. Now create files `/tmp/remoteStep2partition0`
and `/tmp/remoteStep2partition1`:

```
$ hdfs dfs -touch /tmp/remoteStep2partition0
$ hdfs dfs -touch /tmp/remoteStep2partition1
```
Runt the application again:
```
$ java -jar target/dist/gs-yarn-batch-restart-client-0.1.0.jar
```
You should be able to see that application finished successfully and
only failed partitioned steps were executed.

== Test the Application

Below is a class which can be used to execute this application as a
JUnit test without running Hadoop cluster.

`gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist/src/test/java/hello/AppTests.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-batch-restart-dist/src/test/java/hello/AppIT.java[]
----

Running the JUnit test doesn't require existing database instance
because as seen from a above example, a `HSQL` instance is created
within a test itself.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring YARN application!
